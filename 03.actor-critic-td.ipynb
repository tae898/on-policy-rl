    "# Actor-Critic (Temporal Difference): Bootstrapping for Sample Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Leap from Monte Carlo to Temporal Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Actor-Critic Temporal Difference (TD)** - where we make the crucial transition from using complete episode returns to **bootstrapping** with learned value estimates. This represents a fundamental shift in how we learn from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Innovation**: Instead of waiting for complete episodes, we can update our networks every **N steps** using the **Bellman Expectation Equation** to estimate future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 The Bellman Expectation Equation: Foundation of TD Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Two Bellman Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two different Bellman equations** in reinforcement learning, each serving different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Bellman Optimality Equation (Off-Policy Learning)\n",
    "$$V^*(s) = \\max_a \\mathbb{E}[r + \\gamma V^*(s') | s, a]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines the optimal value function\n",
    "- **Used in**: Q-Learning, DQN, off-policy methods\n",
    "- **Characteristic**: Uses **max** operator over actions\n",
    "- **Target**: Find the best possible policy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bellman Expectation Equation (On-Policy Learning)\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[r + \\gamma V^\\pi(s') | s]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines value function for a specific policy $\\pi$\n",
    "- **Used in**: Actor-Critic methods, on-policy learning\n",
    "- **Characteristic**: Uses **expectation** under current policy\n",
    "- **Target**: Evaluate and improve current policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use Bellman Expectation in Actor-Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Since we're learning both a policy (actor) and its value function (critic) simultaneously, we need the **expectation equation** that evaluates our **current policy**, not the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**:\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[r_{t+1} + \\gamma V^\\pi(s_{t+1}) | s_t]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expanded Form**:\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s_t) = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s_t) \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s_t, a) [r(s_t, a, s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implementation**: Since we don't know the environment dynamics $P(s'|s_t, a)$, we use **sample-based estimates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s_t) \\approx r_{t+1} + \\gamma V^\\pi(s_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the **TD target**: $y_t = r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "We avoid dropout in TD methods and use **layer normalization** and **gradient clipping** for stability instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Bootstrapping: The Game Changer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrapping** means using our own estimates to update our estimates. Instead of waiting for actual returns $G_t$, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{TD Target} = r_{t+1} + \\gamma V_\\phi(s_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo vs Temporal Difference Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo (Previous Notebook)**:\n",
    "- **Trajectory**: $s_0 \\xrightarrow{a_0} s_1 \\xrightarrow{a_1} s_2 \\xrightarrow{a_2} \\ldots \\xrightarrow{a_{T-1}} s_T$ (terminal)\n",
    "- **Target**: $G_t = r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+3} + \\ldots + \\gamma^{T-t-1} r_T$\n",
    "- **Update**: After complete episode ($T$ steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Difference (This Notebook)**:\n",
    "- **N-Step Sequence**: $s_t \\xrightarrow{a_t} s_{t+1} \\xrightarrow{a_{t+1}} s_{t+2} \\xrightarrow{a_{t+2}} \\ldots \\xrightarrow{a_{t+N-1}} s_{t+N}$\n",
    "- **Target**: $G_t^{(N)} = r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\ldots + \\gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N} + \\gamma^N V_\\phi(s_{t+N})$\n",
    "- **Update**: Every $N$ steps (where $N \\ll T$ typically)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Efficiency**: Learn from incomplete episodes\n",
    "2. **Online Learning**: Update during episode, not just at the end\n",
    "3. **Lower Variance**: Bootstrapped estimates typically have lower variance than MC\n",
    "4. **Faster Learning**: More frequent updates accelerate convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo**: \n",
    "- ✅ **Unbiased**: $\\mathbb{E}[G_t] = V^\\pi(s_t)$ exactly\n",
    "- ❌ **High Variance**: Episode returns vary dramatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Difference**:\n",
    "- ❌ **Biased**: $\\mathbb{E}[r + \\gamma V(s')] \\neq V^\\pi(s)$ if $V$ is inaccurate\n",
    "- ✅ **Lower Variance**: Single-step rewards plus learned estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight**: Early in training, our value estimates $V_\\phi(s_{t+1})$ are wrong, introducing bias. But as training progresses, $V_\\phi$ becomes more accurate, and the bias decreases while maintaining low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 N-Step Updates: Configurable Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-Step TD** provides a spectrum between Monte Carlo and 1-step TD:\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Step Target Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "For N-step updates, our target becomes:\n",
    "$$G_t^{(N)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\gamma^k r_{t+k+1} + \\gamma^N V_\\phi(s_{t+N})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Cases**:\n",
    "- **N=1**: Pure TD learning $G_t^{(1)} = r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$\n",
    "- **N=T** (episode length): Pure Monte Carlo $G_t^{(T)} = G_t$ (actual return)\n",
    "- **N=5**: Balanced approach (common choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Frequency Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an important difference in learning dynamics compared to Monte Carlo methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo Methods**:\n",
    "- **Episodes**: 1000 episodes\n",
    "- **Network Updates**: 1000 updates (one per episode)\n",
    "- **Update Frequency**: Low\n",
    "- **Learning Speed**: Slower but stable\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-Step TD Methods** (N=5):\n",
    "- **Episodes**: 1000 episodes\n",
    "- **Network Updates**: ~5000+ updates (multiple per episode)\n",
    "- **Update Frequency**: High\n",
    "- **Learning Speed**: Faster but potentially less stable\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Comparison Challenge**: Direct comparison between MC and TD methods is complex because:\n",
    "- Different update frequencies\n",
    "- Different learning dynamics\n",
    "- Different bias-variance profiles\n",
    "- Different data utilization patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Normalization Strategy in TD Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Difference: Why No Critic Loss Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Actor-Critic MC** (Previous Notebook):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We normalized returns for critic learning\n",
    "returns_normalized = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-8)\n",
    "critic_loss = mse_loss(value_predictions, returns_normalized)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Actor-Critic TD** (This Notebook):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# NO normalization of TD targets for critic learning\n",
    "td_targets = rewards + gamma * next_values\n",
    "critic_loss = mse_loss(value_predictions, td_targets)  # No normalization!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Difference Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo Targets** (High Variance):\n",
    "- **Nature**: Raw episode returns $G_t$ with extreme variance\n",
    "- **Range**: LunarLander returns span [-200, +300]\n",
    "- **Problem**: Poor scaling for neural network training\n",
    "- **Solution**: Normalization helps stabilize learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**TD Targets** (Lower Variance):\n",
    "- **Nature**: Bootstrapped estimates $r + \\gamma V(s')$\n",
    "- **Range**: Single rewards plus learned estimates (more controlled)\n",
    "- **Stability**: Naturally more stable than raw episode returns\n",
    "- **Risk**: Normalization would break the value function's meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normalization Breaks TD Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Recursive Relationship Problem**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# TD learning requires consistent scaling across timesteps\n",
    "V(s_t) = r_{t+1} + γ V(s_{t+1})  # This relationship must hold!\n",
    "\n",
    "# If we normalize targets:\n",
    "V(s_t) = normalize(r_{t+1} + γ V(s_{t+1}))  # Breaks recursion!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrapping Requirement**: Since we use $V(s_{t+1})$ to train $V(s_t)$, the value function must maintain consistent scale across all states and timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantage Normalization: Still Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't normalize critic targets, we **absolutely still normalize advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate advantages using TD targets\n",
    "advantages = td_targets - value_predictions.detach()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normalize advantages for stable actor updates\n",
    "advantages_normalized = (advantages - advantages.mean()) / (advantages.std() + 1e-8)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Actor loss uses normalized advantages\n",
    "actor_loss = -(log_probs * advantages_normalized).mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Advantage Normalization Remains Important**:\n",
    "- **Stable Policy Updates**: Prevents destructively large gradient steps\n",
    "- **Consistent Learning Rate**: Maintains effective learning rate across different update batches\n",
    "- **Preserved Relative Importance**: Actions that are relatively better still get stronger signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ TD-Specific Challenge**: Advantage normalization in TD methods is more prone to NaN issues due to smaller batch sizes (N-steps vs full episodes). With fewer samples, the computed standard deviation can be very small, leading to potential division by zero or near-zero during normalization. Care must be taken to ensure numerical stability in these cases. That's why in our implementation, if we run into a NaN issue, we'll only center the advantages, but not scale them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Gradient Norm Clipping: Essential for TD Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why TD Methods Need Gradient Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Instability Challenge**: TD-based Actor-Critic methods face unique stability challenges that make gradient clipping essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Bootstrapping Feedback Loop\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Current Value Estimate → TD Target → Critic Update → New Value Estimate → ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Self-Referential Learning**: Network learns from its own predictions\n",
    "- **Error Amplification**: Mistakes in value estimates compound over time\n",
    "- **Feedback Instability**: Poor estimates create poor targets, leading to worse estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. High Variance from Multiple Sources\n",
    "- **Bootstrapped Targets**: $r + \\gamma V(s')$ depends on potentially inaccurate $V(s')$\n",
    "- **Correlated Samples**: Sequential states in episodes are highly correlated\n",
    "- **On-Policy Distribution**: Data distribution constantly shifts as policy improves\n",
    "- **Policy-Value Coupling**: Actor and critic updates affect each other\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Early Training Chaos\n",
    "- **Random Initialization**: Value estimates start completely wrong\n",
    "- **Exploration Noise**: Policy exploration creates additional variance\n",
    "- **Learning Competition**: Actor and critic learning can interfere with each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Clipping Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max Gradient Norm Clipping**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Clip gradients to prevent explosive updates\n",
    "torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.network.parameters(), max_grad_norm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "1. **Calculate Total Gradient Norm**: $\\|g\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\|g_i\\|^2}$\n",
    "2. **Check Threshold**: If $\\|g\\| > \\text{max\\_grad\\_norm}$\n",
    "3. **Scale Down**: $g_{clipped} = g \\cdot \\frac{\\text{max\\_grad\\_norm}}{\\|g\\|}$\n",
    "4. **Preserve Direction**: Gradient direction unchanged, only magnitude reduced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Gradient Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prevents Explosion**: Stops catastrophically large updates that destroy learning progress\n",
    "2. **Stabilizes Training**: Reduces variance in parameter updates\n",
    "3. **Enables Higher Learning Rates**: Can use more aggressive learning rates safely\n",
    "4. **Improves Convergence**: More stable path to optimal solution\n",
    "5. **Robustness**: Makes training less sensitive to hyperparameter choices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Note: Display Original Gradient Norms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: In our training progress bar, we display the **original (unclipped) gradient norm** for monitoring purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate and store original gradient norm BEFORE clipping\n",
    "original_grad_norm = calculate_gradient_norm(network.parameters())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply gradient clipping\n",
    "torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(network.parameters(), max_grad_norm)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display original norm in progress bar (not the clipped value)\n",
    "progress_bar.set_description(f\"GradNorm: {original_grad_norm:.4f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Display Original Norms**:\n",
    "- **Training Diagnostics**: Monitor if gradients are frequently being clipped\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust `max_grad_norm` based on typical gradient magnitudes\n",
    "- **Stability Assessment**: Track training stability over time\n",
    "- **Debug Information**: Identify potential training issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Actor-Critic TD Architecture\n",

    "The network architecture remains the same as Actor-Critic MC, but the learning algorithm changes fundamentally:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Components (Unchanged)\n",
    "- **Shared Features**: Common representation learning for both actor and critic\n",
