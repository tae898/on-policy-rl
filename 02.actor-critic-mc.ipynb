    "# Actor-Critic (Monte Carlo): Adding Baselines to Reduce Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Variance Problem in REINFORCE\n",
    "\n",
    "From our REINFORCE experiments, we observed **extremely high variance** in gradient estimates. The same action taken in similar states could receive vastly different return signals depending on random episode outcomes. This makes learning unstable and slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Issue**: $\\nabla J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) \\cdot G_t]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $G_t$ (episode return) has **huge variance** because:\n",
    "- Episode outcomes depend on many future actions and environment randomness\n",
    "- One crash late in the episode ruins the signal for all earlier actions\n",
    "- No consideration of \"typical\" performance - each episode is treated independently\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Actor-Critic: The Baseline Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actor-Critic** methods solve the variance problem by introducing a **baseline** - a reference point that doesn't change the expected gradient but reduces variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation: Baseline Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Theorem**: For any baseline $b(s_t)$ that doesn't depend on the action $a_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) \\cdot b(s_t)] = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can subtract any state-dependent baseline from our returns without changing the expected gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) \\cdot (G_t - b(s_t))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: The baseline serves as a \"reference point\" - we only reinforce actions that performed **better than expected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Actor-Critic Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor-Critic methods consist of two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👤 Actor (Policy Network)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Choose actions based on current state\n",
    "- **Output**: Policy distribution $\\pi_\\theta(a|s)$\n",
    "- **Training**: Updated using policy gradient with baseline-reduced variance\n",
    "- **Same as REINFORCE**: Uses log-probability gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎭 Critic (Value Network)  \n",
    "- **Purpose**: Estimate state values to serve as baseline\n",
    "- **Output**: State value estimate $V_\\phi(s)$\n",
    "- **Training**: Minimize mean squared error with actual returns\n",
    "- **New Component**: This is what REINFORCE lacks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 Shared Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have both actor and critic neural networks, but we'll use a **shared architecture** design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared Feature Layer**: Both actor and critic share the first layer since they're processing the same observations and learning related representations\n",
    "2. **Separate Heads**: After the shared features, we have separate branches for actor and critic outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Configuration**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"fc_out_features\": [64],    # Shared features (single layer)\n",
    "\"actor_features\": [64],     # Actor-specific layers after shared\n",
    "\"critic_features\": [64],    # Critic-specific layers after shared\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Design?**\n",
    "- **Feature Sharing**: Both networks benefit from shared low-level feature extraction\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Separate heads allow each component to specialize in its task\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Reduces total parameter count compared to completely separate networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Fair Parameter Comparison with REINFORCE\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a fair comparison with REINFORCE (which only learns the actor/policy network), we deliberately choose a parameter configuration that results in similar total parameter counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**REINFORCE Configuration**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"fc_out_features\": [64, 64, 64],  # Three layers for policy network (~9,500 parameters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actor-Critic Configuration**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"fc_out_features\": [64],    # Shared features\n",
    "\"actor_features\": [64],     # Actor branch  \n",
    "\"critic_features\": [64],    # Critic branch\n",
    "# Total: ~9,500 parameters (similar to REINFORCE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Breakdown**:\n",
    "- **Shared layer**: Processes 8D observations → 64 features\n",
    "- **Actor head**: 64 features → action outputs (4 discrete or 2 continuous)\n",
    "- **Critic head**: 64 features → 1 value output\n",
    "- **Total**: Approximately 9,500 parameters (matching REINFORCE for fair comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that performance differences come from the **algorithmic improvements** (baselines, dual learning objectives) rather than simply having more model capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Two Baseline Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement **two different baseline strategies** to demonstrate the progression from simple to sophisticated variance reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Global Average Return Baseline ($\\bar{G}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline**: $b = \\bar{G} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N G_0^{(i)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N$ = Total number of episodes experienced so far\n",
    "- $i$ = Episode index (superscript denotes episode number)\n",
    "- $G_0^{(i)}$ = Episode return starting from initial state of episode $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why $G_0$ specifically?**\n",
    "- **Episode return**: $G_0^{(i)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{T-1} \\gamma^k r_{k+1}^{(i)}$ is the total discounted return for episode $i$\n",
    "- **Initial state value**: We use $G_0$ (return from time step 0) because it represents the **total episode performance**\n",
    "- **Global metric**: This single number summarizes how well the entire episode went\n",
    "- **State-independent**: Same baseline value used for all states within any episode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Details**:\n",
    "- **Running average**: $\\bar{G} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N G_0^{(i)}$ where $N$ increases with each completed episode\n",
    "- **Updated after each episode**: $\\bar{G}_{new} = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot \\bar{G}_{old} + G_0^{(N)}}{N}$\n",
    "- **Applied to all timesteps**: For episode $i$, all timesteps use the same baseline: $b_t = \\bar{G}$ for all $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- **Simple running average** of all episode returns seen so far\n",
    "- **State-independent**: Same baseline used for all states in all episodes\n",
    "- **Easy to implement**: Just track episode return average\n",
    "- **Limited effectiveness**: Doesn't account for state-specific expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: State-Dependent Value Function Baseline ($V(s_t)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline**: $b(s_t) = V_\\phi(s_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learned value function** that estimates expected return from each state\n",
    "- **State-dependent**: Different baseline for different states\n",
    "- **More sophisticated**: Requires neural network and training\n",
    "- **Better variance reduction**: Accounts for state-specific expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Expected Learning Progression\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to see:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Average Baseline**: Moderate variance reduction compared to REINFORCE\n",
    "2. **Value Function Baseline**: Significant variance reduction and faster convergence\n",
    "3. **Still Monte Carlo**: Both use full episode returns $G_t$ (no bootstrapping yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Normalization in Actor-Critic Methods: The Complete Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Both baseline approaches use **normalization strategies** to ensure stable learning. Understanding these normalizations is crucial for successful Actor-Critic implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Normalizing Advantages and Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Advantage Normalization for Actor** (Always Beneficial ✅):\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Balance updates across actions and stabilize gradient magnitudes\n",
    "- **When**: Applied to policy gradient updates in ALL RL algorithms\n",
    "- **Why Safe**: Preserves relative ordering while preventing extreme updates\n",
    "- **Implementation**: `(advantages - advantages.mean()) / (advantages.std() + 1e-8)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Return Normalization for Critic** (Context-Dependent ⚖️):\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Stabilize value function learning when targets have poor scaling\n",
    "- **When**: Beneficial in MC methods, harmful in TD methods\n",
    "- **Why Context-Dependent**: Depends on the nature of the learning target\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 When to Normalize Critic Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Critic Loss Normalization is Beneficial in Monte Carlo Methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In MC methods, the critic target is the raw episode return:\n",
    "$$y_t = G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{T-t} \\gamma^k r_{t+k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why normalization helps**:\n",
    "- **High variance**: $G_t$ can vary dramatically (LunarLander: -200 to +300)\n",
    "- **Poor scaling**: Raw returns may not be well-scaled for neural network training\n",
    "- **Stability**: Normalized targets lead to more stable value function learning\n",
    "- **Faster convergence**: MSE loss optimization is more efficient with consistent target scales\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Normalize returns for critic learning in MC methods\n",
    "returns_normalized = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-8)\n",
    "critic_loss = mse_loss(value_predictions, returns_normalized)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Critic Loss Normalization is Harmful in Temporal Difference Methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In TD methods (next notebook), the critic target is:\n",
    "$$y_t = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why normalization breaks TD learning**:\n",
    "- **Breaks value function meaning**: The value function must maintain consistent scale across timesteps\n",
    "- **Inconsistent targets**: Normalizing $r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$ creates inconsistent value estimates\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping failure**: The recursive relationship $V(s) = r + \\gamma V(s')$ requires consistent scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: TD methods **bootstrap** (use $V(s_{t+1})$ to train $V(s_t)$), so the value function scale must be consistent across all states and timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Approach 1: Global Average Baseline - Single Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Strategy**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Calculate advantages using global average baseline\n",
    "advantages = returns - global_average_baseline\n",

    "\n",
    "# 3. Actor loss uses normalized advantages\n",
    "actor_loss = -(log_probs * advantages_normalized).mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works**:\n",
    "- **Single normalization step**: Only need to stabilize the actor loss\n",
    "- **No critic learning**: Global average doesn't require neural network training\n",
    "- **Same as REINFORCE**: Uses the same advantage normalization technique from REINFORCE\n",
    "- **Moderate variance reduction**: Better than raw returns but limited by state-independence\n",

    "## ⚡ Advantages over REINFORCE\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Variance**: Baselines significantly reduce gradient variance\n",
    "2. **Faster Convergence**: Lower variance leads to more stable learning\n",
    "3. **Better Sample Efficiency**: More informative gradients per episode\n",
    "4. **Unbiased Estimates**: Baselines don't change expected gradients\n",
    "5. **State-Aware Learning**: Value function baseline considers state-specific expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Still Maintains\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monte Carlo Learning**: Uses full episode returns (no bootstrapping)\n",
    "2. **On-Policy**: Uses only current policy data\n",
    "3. **Unbiased**: No approximation bias in return estimates\n",
    "4. **Action Space Flexibility**: Works with both discrete and continuous actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Episode-Based**: Still must wait for complete episodes\n",
    "2. **No Credit Assignment**: All episode steps get same return signal\n",
    "3. **Function Approximation Error**: Value function introduces approximation\n",
    "4. **Still High Variance**: Variance reduction but not elimination"
