    "# Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Core RL Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning** is fundamentally about learning a **policy** $\\pi$ that maximizes the **expected cumulative discounted reward**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\pi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R_t\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, r_2, ...)$ is a **trajectory** (sequence of states, actions, rewards)\n",
    "- $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is the **discount factor** (how much we value future rewards)\n",
    "- $R_t$ is the reward at time step $t$\n",
    "- $\\pi$ is our **policy** (strategy for choosing actions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Markov Decision Process (MDP) Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "To make RL tractable, we assume the environment follows the **Markov Property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, ..., s_0, a_0) = P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation:** *The future depends only on the present state and action, not the entire history.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Assumption Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without the Markov assumption** (Partially Observable MDPs - POMDPs):\n",
    "- We need to maintain **belief states** over possible true states\n",
    "- The agent must learn to **infer hidden information** from observation history\n",
    "- **Exponentially harder** - need to track probability distributions over states\n",
    "- **Memory becomes crucial** - past observations help disambiguate current state\n",
    "- Examples: Poker (hidden cards), autonomous driving with limited sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "**With the Markov assumption** (Full MDPs):\n",
    "- Current state contains **all relevant information** for decision making\n",
    "- We can use **memoryless policies**: $\\pi(a|s)$ depends only on current state\n",
    "- **Mathematically tractable** - enables dynamic programming approaches\n",
    "- **Most RL algorithms assume this** for computational feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### MDP Components\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP is formally defined as a 5-tuple: $(S, A, P, R, \\gamma)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$S$**: State space (all possible states)\n",
    "- **$A$**: Action space (all possible actions)  \n",
    "- **$P(s'|s,a)$**: Transition probabilities (environment dynamics)\n",
    "- **$R(s,a)$**: Reward function (immediate feedback from current state and action)\n",
    "- **$\\gamma$**: Discount factor (future reward weighting)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎲 Policy Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic vs Deterministic Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Policy:** $\\pi(a|s) = P(\\text{action } a | \\text{state } s)$\n",
    "- Outputs **probability distribution** over actions\n",
    "- **Natural exploration** through randomness\n",
    "- Examples: Softmax policy, Gaussian policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic Policy:** $\\pi(s) = a$\n",
    "- Outputs **single action** for each state  \n",
    "- Requires **external exploration** mechanisms (ε-greedy, noise)\n",
    "- Examples: Greedy policy derived from learned functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterized Policies: The Deep RL Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning a lookup table, we use **function approximation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_\\theta(a|s) = \\text{Neural Network}(s; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\theta$ are the **learnable parameters** (neural network weights).\n",

    "  - Chess: $≈10^{47}$ possible board positions\n",
    "  - Go: $≈10^{170}$ possible board positions (more than atoms in observable universe!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚀 Why Function Approximation Changed Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Generalization Miracle:**\n",
    "- A neural network trained on seeing a lander at position (0.1, 0.5) can **generalize** to position (0.11, 0.51)\n",
    "- **Never seen that exact state before**, but can interpolate from similar experiences\n",

    "\n",
    "**⚠️ PyTorch Implementation Note**: The algorithm above shows **gradient ascent** (step 8: $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\alpha \\cdot g$) because we want to **maximize** the expected return $J(\\pi_\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **PyTorch optimizers perform gradient descent** (minimization) by default. To convert our maximization problem to minimization, we use a simple trick:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\max_\\theta J(\\pi_\\theta) \\equiv \\min_\\theta (-J(\\pi_\\theta))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ The Variance Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### High Variance Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge with REINFORCE is **extremely high variance** in gradient estimates. The gradient estimate for a state-action pair can vary dramatically. In one episode, an action might be part of a successful landing with a high return (e.g., `G_t = 250`). In the next, a crash shortly after that same action results in a very low return (e.g., `G_t = -100`). This provides conflicting update signals for the same action, leading to instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Episode-to-Episode Randomness**: LunarLander episodes can vary based on initial conditions and stochastic dynamics\n",
    "2. **No Averaging**: We use raw episode returns, not smoothed estimates\n",
    "3. **Full Episode Dependence**: One crash can ruin the entire episode's learning\n",
    "4. **Self-Generated Data**: The policy generates its own training data, creating instability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure Monte Carlo Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "🎲 **Key Insight**: REINFORCE uses **actual episode returns** $G_t$, not estimates!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo**: We sample complete episodes and use the true cumulative rewards\n",
    "- **No Bootstrapping**: We never use approximations (those come in future methods!)\n",
    "- **Episode-Based**: Must wait for episode completion before any learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstrating Variance in Our Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code implementation, we'll:\n",
    "- **Track gradient magnitudes** across episodes\n",
    "- **Visualize gradient variance** to see the instability\n",
    "- **Show episode return distributions** to understand the noise\n",
    "- **Compare raw vs smoothed learning curves**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will clearly demonstrate why more advanced methods use techniques like:\n",
    "- **Baselines** to reduce variance\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping** to use estimates instead of raw returns\n",
    "- **Actor-Critic** methods that combine policy and additional learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎲 Handling Different Action Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "For REINFORCE to work, we need to be able to compute $\\log \\pi_\\theta(a|s)$. How we do this depends on the action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Action Space (`continuous=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action Space**: A finite set of actions: [do_nothing, fire_left, fire_main, fire_right]\n",
    "- **Policy Network Output**: The network outputs **logits**, one for each possible action.\n",
    "- **Probability Distribution**: We apply a **Softmax** function to the logits to create a probability distribution over actions.\n",
    "  $$\\pi_\\theta(a|s) = \\text{Softmax}(\\text{logits})_a = \\frac{\\exp(\\text{logit}_a)}{\\sum_{a'} \\exp(\\text{logit}_{a'})}$$\n",
    "- **Action Sampling**: We sample an action from this categorical distribution.\n",
    "- **Log-Probability**: The log-probability is computed directly from the categorical distribution, which is computationally straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Action Space (`continuous=True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action Space**: A 2D vector [main_engine, lateral_booster] with bounds [-1.0, +1.0] each\n",
    "- **Policy Network Output**: The network outputs the **mean** ($\\mu_\\theta(s)$) for a Gaussian distribution for each action dimension. We often use a fixed or learnable standard deviation ($\\sigma$).\n",
    "- **Probability Distribution**: We model the policy as a **Gaussian (Normal) distribution** for each action dimension.\n",
    "  $$\\pi_\\theta(a|s) = \\mathcal{N}(a; \\mu_\\theta(s), \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "- **Action Sampling**: We sample an action vector from this multi-variate Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "- **Log-Probability**: The log-probability is the log-pdf of the Gaussian distribution evaluated at the sampled action.\n",
    "- **Action Clipping**: Since the environment has action bounds ([-1, 1] for each dimension), the sampled actions from the unbounded Gaussian distribution must be clipped before being sent to the environment.\n",

    "## ⚡ Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conceptual Simplicity**: Pure policy optimization, easy to understand\n",

    "   - **Symptom**: Training curves look like noise, very unstable learning\n",
    "   - **Learning Difficulty**: Same action taken with slight timing differences gives vastly different returns\n",
    "2. **Sample Inefficiency**: Must complete entire episodes before any learning\n",
    "3. **No Credit Assignment**: All actions in episode get same return signal\n",
    "4. **Local Optima**: Gradient ascent only finds local maxima"
