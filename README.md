# On-Policy Reinforcement Learning: From Policy Gradients to PPO

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1002873241.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15869035)

A comprehensive educational series of Jupyter notebooks teaching **on-policy reinforcement learning**
algorithms from fundamentals to state-of-the-art. Each notebook demonstrates the progressive evolution
of policy gradient methods using **LunarLander-v3** for consistent comparison across all algorithms.

## üéØ Focus: On-Policy Methods Only

This series exclusively covers **on-policy reinforcement learning**, where the agent learns from data
generated by its current policy. We explore the evolution from pure policy gradients to modern
policy optimization with variance reduction techniques.

**Modern Relevance (2025)**: On-policy RL has become the **de facto standard for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Methods like PPO are used in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for training models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. The stability advantages of on-policy methods make them ideal for the delicate process of aligning pre-trained language models with human preferences.

**Key Theme**: How to solve the high variance problem in policy gradients through:
1. **Baseline subtraction** (Actor-Critic MC)
2. **Bootstrapping** (Actor-Critic TD) 
3. **Trust regions** (PPO)

## üöÄ Our Learning Environment: LunarLander-v3

For this entire learning series, we use **LunarLander-v3** exclusively. This environment
is perfect for RL education because it offers both discrete and continuous action
spaces, rich vector observations, and clear success/failure conditions.

## üìö On-Policy Algorithm Progression

This series focuses on four fundamental **on-policy** RL algorithms that showcase the progression from pure policy gradients to advanced policy optimization with variance reduction techniques.

### 01. REINFORCE (Pure Policy Gradients)

- **Focus**: Vanilla policy gradients with Monte Carlo returns
- **Action Space**: Both discrete AND continuous
- **Key Concepts**: Policy gradient theorem, high variance problem, episode-based learning
- **Value Function**: None - pure policy optimization
- **Target**: Raw episode returns $G_t$
- **Variance**: Extremely high (demonstrates the core challenge)
- **Data Usage**: Fresh experience only (on-policy)

### 02. Actor-Critic (Monte Carlo)

- **Focus**: Adding a value function baseline to reduce variance
- **Action Space**: Both discrete AND continuous
- **Key Concepts**: Actor-critic architecture, baseline subtraction, value function learning
- **Value Function**: $V(s)$ trained toward Monte Carlo returns $G_t$
- **Target**: $G_t - V(s_t)$ (advantage estimation)
- **Bellman Equation**: ‚ùå No - still uses full episode returns for value training
- **Variance**: Reduced compared to REINFORCE
- **Data Usage**: Fresh experience only (on-policy)
- **Learning Progression**: Start with simple running mean $\bar{G}$ baseline, then progress to learned state-dependent value function $V(s_t)$, demonstrating how $G_t - V(s_t)$ reduces variance while maintaining unbiased estimates

### 03. Actor-Critic (Temporal Difference)

- **Focus**: Bootstrapping and the Bellman equation - the bridge to modern RL
- **Action Space**: Both discrete AND continuous  
- **Key Concepts**: TD learning, bootstrapping, bias-variance tradeoff
- **Value Function**: $V(s)$ trained toward TD target $r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1})$
- **Target**: $r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$ (TD error as advantage)
- **Bellman Equation**: ‚úÖ Yes - introduces bootstrapping
- **Variance**: Lower than MC methods, but introduces bias
- **Data Usage**: Fresh experience only (on-policy)

### 04. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

- **Focus**: Trust regions, clipped objectives, and modern policy optimization
- **Action Space**: Both discrete AND continuous
- **Key Concepts**: Importance sampling, trust regions, clipped surrogate objective, GAE
- **Value Function**: $V(s)$ with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- **Key Innovation**: Clipped policy updates prevent destructive policy changes
- **Modern Standard**: State-of-the-art on-policy algorithm used in practice
- **Data Usage**: Fresh experience only (on-policy)

## üéØ Learning Progression: The Variance-Bias Journey

### The Core Problem: Policy Gradient Variance

**REINFORCE**: $\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot G_t]$
- **High Variance**: $G_t$ varies wildly between episodes
- **Unbiased**: Uses true returns, no approximations
- **On-Policy**: Uses data from current policy only

### Solution 1: Baselines (Reduce Variance)

**Actor-Critic (MC)**: $\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot (G_t - V(s_t))]$
- **Lower Variance**: Subtracting baseline $V(s_t)$ reduces variance
- **Still Unbiased**: Baseline doesn't change expectation
- **Episode-Based**: Still waits for full episodes
- **On-Policy**: Still uses data from current policy only

### Solution 2: Bootstrapping (Reduce Variance Further)

**Actor-Critic (TD)**: $\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot \delta_t]$

Where $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$ (TD error)
- **Much Lower Variance**: Single-step updates vs episode-length
- **Introduces Bias**: Uses $V(s_{t+1})$ estimate instead of true future returns
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Can learn from individual transitions
- **On-Policy**: Still uses data from current policy only

### Solution 3: Stable Policy Updates (Control Update Size)

**PPO**: Adds trust region constraints to prevent destructive policy changes
- **Clipped Objective**: Limits how much policy can change per update
- **GAE**: Sophisticated advantage estimation balancing bias and variance
- **Practical Stability**: Works reliably across many environments
- **On-Policy**: Uses fresh data for each policy update

## üìä On-Policy Algorithm Comparison Matrix

| Algorithm | Value Function | Bellman Equation | Variance | Bias | Update Frequency | Data Usage |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|----------|------|------------------|------------|
| REINFORCE | None | ‚ùå No | Very High | None | Per Episode | On-Policy |
| Actor-Critic (MC) | $V(s) \rightarrow G_t$ | ‚ùå No | High | None | Per Episode | On-Policy |
| Actor-Critic (TD) | $V(s) \rightarrow r + \gamma V(s')$ | ‚úÖ Yes | Medium | Low | Per Step | On-Policy |
| PPO | $V(s)$ + GAE | ‚úÖ Yes | Low | Low | Per Batch | On-Policy |

## üîÑ Key On-Policy Learning Concepts

### On-Policy vs Off-Policy

**On-Policy Methods** (all algorithms in this series):
- Learn from data generated by the **current policy** being optimized
- Must collect **fresh experience** after each policy update
- **Sample efficiency**: Lower (can't reuse old data)
- **Stability**: Generally more stable and easier to tune
- **Modern Applications**: Standard for LLM fine-tuning (RLHF), robotics, continuous control
- **Examples**: REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, PPO, A3C

**Off-Policy Methods** (not covered in this series):
- Can learn from data generated by **any policy** (including old versions)
- Can **reuse experience** through replay buffers
- **Sample efficiency**: Higher (reuses data)
- **Stability**: Often less stable, harder to tune, can suffer from distribution shift
- **Trade-off**: More sample efficient but less stable than on-policy methods
- **Examples**: DQN, DDPG, TD3, SAC

**Why On-Policy Dominates LLM Fine-tuning**: The stability of on-policy methods is crucial when fine-tuning billion-parameter language models where catastrophic forgetting or policy collapse can destroy months of pre-training work.

### Monte Carlo vs Temporal Difference

**Monte Carlo Methods** (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic MC):
- Use **complete episode returns** $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^T \gamma^{k-t} r_{k+1}$
- **Unbiased** but **high variance**
- Must wait for episode completion
- No bootstrapping

**Temporal Difference Methods** (Actor-Critic TD, PPO):
- Use **one-step lookahead** $r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1})$
- **Lower variance** but **introduces bias**
- Can learn from incomplete episodes
- **Bootstrapping**: Uses estimates to update estimates

### Variance Reduction Techniques

1. **Baseline Subtraction**: $G_t - b$ where $b$ doesn't depend on actions
2. **Value Function Approximation**: Learn $V(s)$ to predict returns
3. **Advantage Estimation**: Use $A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)$ instead of raw returns
4. **Trust Regions**: Limit policy update magnitude (PPO clipping)

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in On-Policy Methods

- **High Variance ‚Üí Slow Learning**: REINFORCE takes many episodes to converge
- **Bias Introduction ‚Üí Faster Learning**: TD methods converge faster but to potentially suboptimal policies
- **Modern Methods**: Balance bias and variance for practical performance
- **On-Policy Constraint**: All methods must use fresh data, affecting sample efficiency
